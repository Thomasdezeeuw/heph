1.  Introduction

   This document registers those Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   methods that have been defined in RFCs other than [RFC7231] before
   the IANA HTTP Method Registry was established.

2.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations related to the registration
   itself.

   Security considerations applicable to the individual HTTP methods
   ought to be discussed in the specifications that define them.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The table below provides registrations of HTTP method names that have
   been added to the IANA "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Method
   Registry" at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods> (see
   Section 8.1 of [RFC7231]).
