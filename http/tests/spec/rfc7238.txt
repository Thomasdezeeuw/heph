1.  Introduction

   HTTP defines a set of status codes for the purpose of redirecting a
   request to a different URI ([RFC3986]).  The history of these status
   codes is summarized in Section 6.4 of [RFC7231], which also
   classifies the existing status codes into four categories.

   The first of these categories contains the status codes 301 (Moved
   Permanently), 302 (Found), and 307 (Temporary Redirect), which can be
   classified as below:

   +-------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+
   |                                           | Permanent | Temporary |
   +-------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+
   | Allows changing the request method from   | 301       | 302       |
   | POST to GET                               |           |           |
   | Does not allow changing the request       | -         | 307       |
   | method from POST to GET                   |           |           |
   +-------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+

   Section 6.4.7 of [RFC7231] states that HTTP does not define a
   permanent variant of status code 307; this specification adds the
   status code 308, defining this missing variant (Section 3).

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  308 Permanent Redirect

   The 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code indicates that the target
   resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future
   references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.

RFC 7238                  HTTP Status Code 308                 June 2014


   Clients with link editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link
   references to the effective request URI (Section 5.5 of [RFC7230]) to
   one or more of the new references sent by the server, where possible.

   The server SHOULD generate a Location header field ([RFC7231],
   Section 7.1.2) in the response containing a preferred URI reference
   for the new permanent URI.  The user agent MAY use the Location field
   value for automatic redirection.  The server's response payload
   usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new
   URI(s).

   A 308 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise
   indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see
   [RFC7234], Section 4.2.2).

      Note: This status code is similar to 301 (Moved Permanently)
      ([RFC7231], Section 6.4.2), except that it does not allow changing
      the request method from POST to GET.

4.  Deployment Considerations

   Section 6 of [RFC7231] requires recipients to treat unknown 3xx
   status codes the same way as status code 300 Multiple Choices
   ([RFC7231], Section 6.4.1).  Thus, servers will not be able to rely
   on automatic redirection happening similar to status codes 301, 302,
   or 307.

   Therefore, initial use of status code 308 will be restricted to cases
   where the server has sufficient confidence in the client's
   understanding the new code or when a fallback to the semantics of
   status code 300 is not problematic.  Server implementers are advised
   not to vary the status code based on characteristics of the request,
   such as the User-Agent header field ("User-Agent Sniffing") -- doing
   so usually results in code that is both hard to maintain and hard to
   debug and would also require special attention to caching (i.e.,
   setting a "Vary" response header field, as defined in Section 7.1.4
   of [RFC7231]).

   Note that many existing HTML-based user agents will emulate a refresh
   when encountering an HTML <meta> refresh directive ([HTML]).  This
   can be used as another fallback.  For example:

   Client request:

     GET / HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com

   Server response:

     HTTP/1.1 308 Permanent Redirect
     Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
     Location: http://example.com/new
     Content-Length: 454

              The document has been moved to

              >http://example.com/new</a>.
           </p>
        </body>
     </html>

5.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations that apply to HTTP redirects apply to the
   308 status code as well (see Section 9 of [RFC7231]).

6.  IANA Considerations

   The registration below has been added to the "Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP) Status Code Registry" (defined in Section 8.2 of
   [RFC7231] and located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes>):

   +-------+--------------------+---------------------------------+
   | Value | Description        | Reference                       |
   +-------+--------------------+---------------------------------+
   | 308   | Permanent Redirect | Section 3 of this specification |
   +-------+--------------------+---------------------------------+
