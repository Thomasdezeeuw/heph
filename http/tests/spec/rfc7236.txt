1.  Introduction

   This document registers Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   authentication schemes that have been defined in RFCs before the IANA
   HTTP Authentication Scheme Registry was established.

2.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations related to the registration
   itself.

   Security considerations applicable to the individual authentication
   schemes ought to be discussed in the specifications that define them.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The registrations below have been added to the IANA "Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Scheme Registry" at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-authschemes> (see Section 5.1
   of [RFC7235]).

   | Negotiate      | [RFC4559], | This authentication scheme violates |
   |                | Section 3  | both HTTP semantics (being          |
   |                |            | connection-oriented) and syntax     |
   |                |            | (use of syntax incompatible with    |
   |                |            | the WWW-Authenticate and            |
   |                |            | Authorization header field syntax). |
   | OAuth          | [RFC5849], |                                     |

   |                | 3.5.1      |                                     |
