# TODO

* TCP listen on local address for incoming connections.
* Change NewActor argument. For TCP it's the remote address and for UDP it's the
  local address, kind of confusing:
  * Change Config::tcp to accept remote and local address.
  * Change Config::udp to accept local address.
* Add connected UDP.
* Add RPC support. Add a new variant to `UdpRelayMessage`? The problem is that
  we might want to support multiple RPCs, but how do we keep the types correct?
